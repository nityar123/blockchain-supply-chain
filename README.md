# Blockchain-Based Supply Chain Management System ⛓️

This project implements a blockchain-based supply chain management system using Python. It simulates the addition, mining, and tracking of transactions in a decentralized ledger, enabling secure and transparent tracking of products across the supply chain.

## Features
- **Dynamic Input System**: Add transactions with details such as sender, receiver, product, and quantity.
- **Blockchain Implementation**: Includes a genesis block and support for mining new blocks.
- **Transparent Tracking**: View all transactions stored securely in the blockchain.
- **Proof of Work**: Ensures security through mining and hashing.

## How It Works
1. **Add Transactions**: Input details of a transaction (e.g., sender, receiver, product, quantity).
2. **Mine Transactions**: Add pending transactions to the blockchain by solving a proof-of-work problem.
3. **View Blockchain**: Display the entire blockchain, showing each block's transactions, timestamp, and hash.
